#data for replicating this analysis can be found at GSE277878, GSE277879, GSE277880

#This code requires the following packages (along with associated dependencies) and has been run in RStudio (v4.3.1):

Seurat (v4.3.1)
sctransform (v0.3.5)
Harmony (v0.1.1) 
BayesSpace (v1.6.0) 
Sp (v2.0-0)
gsfisher (v0.2)
EnhancedVolcano (v1.13.2) 
ComplexHeatmap (v2.10) 
spatula (v0.0.0.9)
DESeq2 (v1.40.2)


#Expected output: All the main outputs are plots from the above packages depicting spatial gene expression/scRNAseq gene expression
#Expected run time: Runtime will vary, analysis was performed using a HPC with an R session of about 160 gb of RAM
